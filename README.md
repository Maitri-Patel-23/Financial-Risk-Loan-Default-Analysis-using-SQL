| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Very High Risk customers contribute most to defaults           | Identified by combining low income, poor credit score, and high EMI burden | Bank should review lending policy for these segments or require additional guarantees |
| Cities with highest default rates                              | e.g., City X, City Y have highest % of defaults                            | Consider targeted credit checks or financial literacy programs                        |
| Loan-to-income ratio is key predictor                          | Medium Income group with high loan-to-income ratio shows higher default    | Adjust maximum allowable loan-to-income ratio for Medium Income group                 |
| Credit score & EMI burden are strongly correlated with default | Correlation analysis confirms predictive power                             | Use as features in predictive risk scoring models                                     |




# Loan Default Analysis

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive **loan default analysis** using SQL and Python. It is designed to demonstrate **financial analysis skills**, **data cleaning**, **risk modeling**, and **visualization**, making it suitable for roles like **Financial Analyst** or **Consulting at IBM**.

The analysis covers:
- Cleaning and preprocessing raw loan data.
- Default rate analysis by **income group**, **credit score**, and **EMI burden**.
- Risk segmentation: **Very High, High, Medium, Low**.
- Loan portfolio exposure analysis.
- Top cities with highest default rate.
- Loan-to-income ratio insights.
- Correlation analysis for predictive insights.
- Visualizations to highlight actionable insights.
